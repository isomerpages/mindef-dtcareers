<p style="margin-bottom:3rem;">The DS&T sector provides multiple openings, streams, and programmes that cater to applicants from a variety of experience levels and backgrounds — from students to mid-career switchers. We strive to provide a rewarding experience for all our employees by aligning their interests with a role and career path that optimises their capabilities, talents and growth.</p>

<h4 style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:2rem;">Graduates & Professionals</h4>

<p style="margin-top:1rem;">While each agency boasts its own quirks, culture and ethos, DS&T provides a common thread which drives and fosters a positive and flexible work environment where you can take ownership of and champion new initiatives that lead to more efficient processes, a healthier work-life balance, and greater inclusivity. </p>
<p>
For truly innovative work to happen, we also understand the importance of creating a safe, collaborative space. One that will allow you and your team to repeatedly test your ideas — and fail — before landing on successful outcomes. 
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, a strong work ethic underpins the way we work and communicate. During your time 
with us, we hope to impart the values of professionalism, integrity, passion, innovation, excellence 
and teamwork.
