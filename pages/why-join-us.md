<p style="margin-top:1rem;">In the DS&T sector, much of our success is built on the foundation of effective inter and intra-agency knowledge sharing, teamwork and collaboration. We’re committed to the mobility of our people, and value the passion they have for continued learning and original, creative thought.

We provide various opportunities — lateral ones for those eager to expand their scope and try new roles, and vertical ones for high-performers. Those who are recognised are rewarded through advancements and awards, and are given the chance to work with international partners and thought leaders.
