<img src="images/join-opportunities.png"/>

<p style="margin-top:1rem;">While each agency boasts its own quirks, culture and ethos, DS&T provides a common thread which drives and fosters a positive and flexible work environment where you can take ownership of and champion new initiatives that lead to more efficient processes, a healthier work-life balance, and greater inclusivity. </p>
<p>
For truly innovative work to happen, we also understand the importance of creating a safe, collaborative space. One that will allow you and your team to repeatedly test your ideas — and fail — before landing on successful outcomes. 
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, a strong work ethic underpins the way we work and communicate. During your time 
with us, we hope to impart the values of professionalism, integrity, passion, innovation, excellence 
and teamwork.
