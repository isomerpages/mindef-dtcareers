<p style="">Singapore is a small state with limited resources like land and manpower. Coupled with an unpredictable security environment and a lack of strategic depth, we face a tall hurdle in maintaining our borders and the safety of our people. DS&T plays a key role in Singapore’s efforts to overcome these challenges by adapting its defensive capabilities to these unique circumstances.</p>
<p>
Our future-facing stance on innovation and leveraging of tech as a force multiplier is crucial in the face 
of ever-evolving security threats such as terrorism, cyberattacks, resource contamination and 
biochemical attacks.

<p style="margin-top:1rem;">In the DS&T sector, much of our success is built on the foundation of effective inter and intra-agency knowledge sharing, teamwork and collaboration. We’re committed to the mobility of our people, and value the passion they have for continued learning and original, creative thought. 
 </p>
<p>
We provide various opportunities — lateral ones for those eager to expand their scope and try new roles, and vertical ones for high-performers. Those who are recognised are rewarded through advancements and awards, and are given the chance to work with international partners and thought leaders.
