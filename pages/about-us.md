<p style="">Singapore is a small state with limited resources like land and manpower. Coupled with an unpredictable security environment and a lack of strategic depth, we face a tall hurdle in maintaining our borders and the safety of our people. DS&T plays a key role in Singapore’s efforts to overcome these challenges by adapting its defensive capabilities to these unique circumstances.</p>
<p>
Our future-facing stance on innovation and leveraging of tech as a force multiplier is crucial in the face 
of ever-evolving security threats such as terrorism, cyberattacks, resource contamination and 
biochemical attacks.

<p>Singapore’s first foray into defence tech was in 1966 with just three engineers in the Logistics Department. Today, the community boasts over 6,500 scientists, engineers and IT specialists who support Singapore’s defence through their expertise in various fields of knowledge with, the leading agencies being DSTA, DSO and the CSIT. <p>
	
<h4 style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:2rem;">Our Defence Technology Ecosystem</h4>
<p>Beyond the three agencies, there is a larger ecosystem that includes local industry organisations, local research institutes, and foreign partners in public and private sectors. These partnerships help us to further maximise our capabilities development. It also advances our defence diplomacy and relations, helping us gain access to technology, training, and test facilities.  <p>
